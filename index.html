        Intro: My name is Dylan Shaw, and I do a lot of running. Recently I downloaded Spotify and decided that I should try and build a playlist of music for when I am running.
        Today I'm going to tell you about some of my favorite albums to listen to while I am running (or working out in general), as well as some of my favorite work out songs.
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="bold fonts">American Beauty/American Psycho</h3>
        <h4 class="bold fonts">By: Fall Out Boy</h4>
        This has always been one of my favorite albums from Fall Out Boy. My sister even gave me a CD of this album for Christmas when I was in High School. 
        Released in 2015, this album has some of their biggest hits including Centuries, Immortals, and Uma Therman.
        My favorite songs are Novocaine and Jet Pack Blues. There are a total of 11 songs with a total run time of 39 minutes and 7 seconds.<br>
        <h4 class="fonts">Setlist:</h4>
        <ol  class="fonts">
            <li>Irresistible</li>
            <li>American Beauty/American Psycho</li>
            <li>Centuries</li>

            <li>Immortals</li>

        </ol><br><br>

        <h3 class="bold fonts">When Legends Rise</h3>
        <h4 class="bold fonts">By: Godsmack</h4>
        I first heard the songs Bulletproof and Unforgettable on the radio, but I was introduced to the rest of the album by some people in my mythology class.
        Of all the albums to listen to while running, this is easily the one I've listened to the most. Released in 2018, this album has a total of 11 songs and runs for about 38 minutes and 20 seconds.
        This album was my primary motivating factor during the quarantine of 2020. My favorite songs are When Legends Rise, Say My Name, and Unforgettable. <br>
        <h4  class="fonts">Setlist:</h4>
        <ol  class="fonts">
            <li>When Legends Rise</li>
            <li>Bulletproof</li>
            <li>Unforgettable</li>
            <li>Every Part Of Me</li>
            <li>Take It To The Edge</li>
            <li>Under Your Scars</li>
            <li>Someday</li>
            <li>Just One Time</li>
            <li>Say My Name</li>
            <li>Let it Out</li>
            <li>Eye Of The Storm</li>
        </ol><br><br>

        <h3 class="bold fonts">ATTENTION ATTENTION</h3>
        <h4 class="bold fonts">By: Shinedown</h4>
        Released in 2018 this album has 14 songs and runs for 50 minutes and 32 seconds. MONSTERS was a song that was praised for years because of it's themes about depression and it's animated music video.
        MONSTERS is easily my favorite song with ATTENTION ATTENTION and DEVIL close behind. I also love how the first song is only 39 seconds long because it is meant to be an introduction for what is about to come.
        Also, I think it was a very interesting (and ironic) that the only song title that is not in all caps is titled "special". <br>
        <h4 class="fonts">Setlist:</h4>
        <ol  class="fonts">
            <li>THE ENTRANCE</li>
            <li>DEVIL</li>

        </ol><br><br>

        Here is a video from youtube. Someone decided to put all the Godsmack songs that I talked about into a single video, so it is here if you would like to listen to it. <br><br>
